<p>These are examples of using Inkscape when working on branding.</p>

	<p>This work started from sketches that Jimmac did during Libre Graphics Meeting 2008 in Wroc≈Çaw.</p>

	<p>The main character is called Dister, and here another sample of going from a sketch...</p>

	<p>...to a complete vector drawing.</p>

	<p>At a later stage of design process Blender was involved, so here is a comparison between 2D drawing in Inkscape and a 3D rendering of Dister.</p>

	<p>At some point Jimmac created a small comic featuring Dister, but it wasn't used in the final version of the package. Nevertheless, here is what he says about it:</p>

	<p>"It is very convenient to work with bitmap objects as well as vectors. Comic book artists have the freedom to re-arrange the flow. By converting an image into a pattern, it is possible to easily create masks on the bitmap. The node tool provides nice control mechanism to edit the 'texture' on such objects. Bitmap patterns can be scaled, moved or rotated directly on canvas".</p>
